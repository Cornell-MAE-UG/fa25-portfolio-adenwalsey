#### Projects
- **Child Restraint System Capstone Project** — Cornell University  
  *Advisor: Marty Murtagh | Fall 2025*  
  - Led mechanical design of a modular, multi-stage child car seat platform in Fusion 360, reducing part count and enabling component reuse across age ranges.  
  - Translated user and safety requirements into engineering targets using QFD and DFMEA to guide material selection and structural layout.  
  - Validated structural performance using ANSYS under FMVSS 213 frontal crash load cases, achieving acceptable factors of safety with system weight under 20 lbs and 48% improved lifecycle sustainability.

- **Load Cell Finite Element Analysis** — Cornell University  
  *Advisor: Alan Zehnder | Fall 2024*  
  - Modeled a ring-shaped load cell with strain gauges and evaluated stress, strain, and deflection using ANSYS.  
  - Iterated design parameters to maximize voltage output while maintaining required safety factors.  
  - Validated simulation results with hand calculations to confirm accuracy.

- **Bicycle Chain Cleaner & Lubricator** — Cornell University  
  *Mechanical Synthesis Course | Spring 2024*  
  - Collaborated on the design of an affordable, user-friendly bicycle chain cleaning system.  
  - Designed a multi-chamber housing with variable orifices in Fusion 360 to control fluid flow rate over the chain.

#### Work Experience
- **Manufacturing Engineer Intern — Mainspring Energy**  
  *Menlo Park, CA | Summer 2025*  
  - Designed, assembled, and validated a pneumatic jaw tooling jig to remove copper wire insulation and activate bond coat via electrical current, reducing stator manufacturing process time by 60%.  
  - Devised and executed qualification tests for injection-molded shipping crates under simulated shipping conditions to verify structural robustness and safety factors.  
  - Conducted Gage R&R studies for eddy current sensors to quantify repeatability and reproducibility prior to stator shipment.

- **R&D Engineer Intern — Neodyne Biosciences, Inc.**  
  *Fremont, CA | Summer 2024*  
  - Performed tolerance analyses to improve manufacturability and simplify assembly, producing detailed SolidWorks drawings for manufacturing.  
  - Developed and implemented adhesion test methods, reducing defective products by over 70%.  
  - Evaluated low-tack liner materials to ensure compatibility with automated production equipment.

- **Robotics Teacher — Pinewood School**  
  *Los Altos, CA | Summer 2023*  
  - Taught students to design, build, and program robotics systems, emphasizing engineering fundamentals and problem-solving skills.
