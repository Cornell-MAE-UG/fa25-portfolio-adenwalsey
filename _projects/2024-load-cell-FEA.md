### Objective: 
- Conduct Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on a load cell to evaluate stress, strain, and deflection under applied loads.

### Outcomes:
- Modeled load cell geometry in Fusion 360 and used ANSYS to perform FEA simulation.
- Verified FEA results by comparing maximum normal stress, deflection, and strain at gauge locations versus hand calculations.
- Evaluated the factor of safety for strength, fatigue, and crack growth to assess structural integrity.

### Contributions:
- Wrote hand calculations and 
theoretical analysis to benchmark results (see code below).
- Created stress and strain contour plots
to visualize load distribution.
- Selected material based on 
properties to fit load cell criteria of yield 
strength and fracture toughness.
