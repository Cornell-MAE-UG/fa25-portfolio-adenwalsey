### Objective: 
-	Dissect a system with a fluid mechanical component and understand how it works based on concepts learned from Fluid Mechanics course at Cornell University.
<br>
<br>
<br>

### Outcomes:
-	Dissected and analyzed fluid mechanics of the impeller in a stationary bicycle trainer housed in silicone-based oil.
-	Calculated drag force, Reynolds number, and mechanical advantage of impeller to evaluate system behavior.
-	Created a video presenting the system’s operations and our findings, including modeling the flow using Navier-Stokes equations and how
-	 the system would change with variations in fluid
properties.
<br>

### Contributions:
- Took system measurements such as impeller length and wheel diameter.
- Used approximations for impeller such as thin-walled, flat plate area, and incompressible/mean averaged/Reynold’s averaged flow to simplify calculations (see Appendix – Bicycle Trainer).
- Compared viscosity of oil to other liquids such as 
water and honey to understand why the 
silicone-based oil is the most efficient.
