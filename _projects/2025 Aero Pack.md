### Objective: 
-	Design and fabricate a lightweight, aerodynamic saddle bag that integrates cleanly with a Canyon Ultimate seatpost, minimizes drag, and securely carries essential ride items using a custom CAD model and 3D-printed prototype.

### Design Requirements
- Minimize frontal and side projected area behind the seatpost.
- Maintain secure mounting under dynamic road vibration.
- Achieve low mass while preserving sufficient stiffness.
- Allow one-handed access to contents.
- Fit common cycling tools.
- Be fully manufacturable via desktop FDM 3D printing.

### Key Design Features
- Streamlined and tapered housing to reduce flow separation behind the saddle.
- Integrated rear light mount aligned within wake region.
- Custom saddle-rail clamp geometry for rigid attachment without straps.
- Smooth exterior surfaces with controlled fillets to reduce stress concentrations and drag.
- Modular interface allowing light removal independent of the bag.

### Outcomes:
-	Successfully produced a functional, lightweight saddle bag prototype.
- Achieved a compact, aero-conscious form factor compared to traditional fabric bags.
- Demonstrated secure mounting with no sway during riding.
- Integrated rear lighting without additional mounts or straps.

### Next Steps
- Conduct CFD analysis to confirm drag reduction, evaluate flow separation, and identify downstream wake region.
- Consider alternative slicing configuration to reduce stress concentrations and mitigate printing failures.
