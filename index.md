## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a fourth-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University passionate about design, innovation, and system optimization. My love for fast machines such as bicycles, cars, boats, and planes motivated me to pursue an engineering career. As a coxswain for Cornell’s Lightweight Rowing team and an avid cyclist, I enjoy applying engineering principles to enhance real-world performance. A question that drives me is: how can I combine my love for sport with my engineering knowledge to make a system perform better?  When I’m not in the boat, on the bike, or in the classroom, you can find me prototyping bike parts or cooking while listening to ‘90s rap.
